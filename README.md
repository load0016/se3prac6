Baggage Handling System for a Major Airport: Denver Airport Baggage Handling System

Approaching the Design
----------------------

The baggage handling system for the Denver Airport will be the base of this test plan. The design of the baggage handling system is to automate the handling of baggage through the entire airport. From initial check-in/arrival, the baggage would be sent through the airport to the desired location will minimal human interaction which would minimalize flight delays and less waiting with baggage carousels.

Risks of this Design
--------------------

 - Identification of baggage: make it difficult to determine where the baggage goes when problems occur
 - Mechanical failure: can cause major delays if human baggage handlers aren’t on stand when problems occur
 - Misdirection of baggage: can occur when baggage isn’t labelled correctly from check-in
